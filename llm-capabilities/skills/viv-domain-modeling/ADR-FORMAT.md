# ADR Format

An ADR lives with the code it binds, and uses sequential numbering: `0001-slug.md`, `0002-slug.md`, and so on.

- A decision of one package goes to `packages/<name>/docs/adr/`.
- A decision that crosses a package goes to the root `docs/adr/`.
- A repository with no package layout keeps every ADR in the root `docs/adr/`.

Make the directory lazily: only when you write the first ADR.

## Template

```md
# {Short title of the decision}

{1-3 sentences: what's the context, what did we decide, and why.}
```

That is all. An ADR can be a single paragraph. The value is in recording *that* a decision was made and *why*, not in filling out sections.

## Optional sections

Only include these when they add genuine value. Most ADRs do not need them.

- **Status** frontmatter (`proposed | accepted | deprecated | superseded by ADR-NNNN`): useful when decisions are revisited
- **Considered Options**: only when the rejected alternatives are worth remembering
- **Consequences**: only when non-obvious downstream effects need to be called out

## Numbering

Scan the `docs/adr/` that receives the file for the highest existing number, and increment by one. Each directory numbers on its own.

## When to offer an ADR

All three of these must be true:

1. **Hard to reverse**: the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context**: a future reader will look at the code and wonder "why on earth did they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off**: there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons

If a decision is easy to reverse, skip it: you will just reverse it. If it is not surprising, nobody will wonder why. If there was no real alternative, there is nothing to record beyond "we did the obvious thing."

### What qualifies

- **Architectural shape.** "We use a monorepo." "The write model is event-sourced, the read model is projected into Postgres."
- **Integration patterns between contexts.** "Ordering and Billing communicate through domain events, not synchronous HTTP."
- **Technology choices that carry lock-in.** Database, message bus, auth provider, deployment target. Not every library: just the ones that would take a quarter to swap out.
- **Boundary and scope decisions.** "The Customer context owns customer data. Other contexts reference it by ID only." The explicit no-s are as valuable as the yes-s.
- **Deliberate deviations from the obvious path.** "We use manual SQL instead of an ORM because X." Anything where a reasonable reader would assume the opposite. These stop the next engineer from "fixing" something that was deliberate.
- **Constraints not visible in the code.** "We cannot use AWS because of compliance requirements." "Response times must be under 200ms because of the partner API contract."
- **Rejected alternatives when the rejection is non-obvious.** If you considered GraphQL and picked REST for subtle reasons, record it. Otherwise, someone will suggest GraphQL again in six months.
