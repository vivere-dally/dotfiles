/**
 * ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English gate: the checker, shared by every harness.
 *
 * This module does no I/O of its own: no stdin, no `process.exit`, and no `Bun.*`
 * call. Claude Code and Codex reach it through `cli.ts` under Bun, the opencode
 * plugin loads it in the Bun runtime of opencode, and the pi extension loads it in
 * Node through jiti. Each caller gives it a `read` function for the files it needs.
 *
 * Part 2 of the standard (the dictionary) is not redistributable, so nothing here
 * embeds it. Every lexical rule is read at runtime from the `### Word traps` table
 * in `rules/ste.md`: one source of truth, and no copy of the standard in a public repo.
 *
 * Findings carry a confidence class because only the commit surface blocks:
 *   hard — deterministic; no part-of-speech or context judgment is possible to get
 *          wrong. Only these can deny a commit.
 *   soft — heuristic (voice, tense, words whose legality depends on part of speech).
 *          Advice only.
 * A gate that denies on a guess teaches people to route around it, so the blocking
 * set is deliberately the narrow one and grows only if a rule proves deterministic.
