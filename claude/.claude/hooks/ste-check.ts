/**
 * ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English gate for every repository.
 *
 * Part 2 of the standard (the dictionary) is not redistributable, so nothing here
 * embeds it. Every lexical rule is read at runtime from the `### Word traps` table
 * in ~/.claude/rules/ste.md: one source of truth, and no copy of the standard in a
 * public repo.
 *
 * Findings carry a confidence class because only the commit surface blocks:
 *   hard — deterministic; no part-of-speech or context judgment is possible to get
 *          wrong. Only these can deny a commit.
 *   soft — heuristic (voice, tense, words whose legality depends on part of speech).
 *          Advice only.
 * A gate that denies on a guess teaches people to route around it, so the blocking
 * set is deliberately the narrow one and grows only if a rule proves deterministic.
 *
 * Two entry points share one checker. As a hook it reads the event on stdin and
 * answers with the hook protocol: a tool event gates the payload of the call,
 * `UserPromptSubmit` injects the reply contract out of the rules, and `Stop` gates
 * the reply itself against the contract budget. As `ste-check.ts --file <path>` it
 * prints a plain report and exits 1 on a hard finding, so a person and a CI job
 * get the same verdict.
